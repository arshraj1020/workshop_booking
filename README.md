# Enhancing UI/UX of Workshop Booking System (FOSSEE Task)

> A mobile-first design to improve usability and user experience of the booking portal for students.

## About the Project

Enhancement of the existing UI/UX of the original FOSSEE Workshop Booking System.

Objective:

## 👥 User Roles & Account Setup

This system supports two types of users:

### 👨‍🏫 Instructor
- Can **accept workshops**
- Can **edit workshop types**
- Can **update workshop details**
- Has higher privileges in the system

### 👨‍💼 Coordinator

---
## ⚙️ Setup Instructions(Error may come during execution please follow all commands)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/workshop_booking.git
cd workshop_booking
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
source venv/bin/activate   # Mac/Linux
pip install -r requirements.txt
rmdir /s /q venv
py -3.9 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

## Quick Account Setup (Without Email Verification)

Since email verification is disabled for testing, users can be created directly using Django shell.

### 🔹 Step 1: Open shell

```bash
python manage.py shell
```

### 🔹 Step 2: Create Instructor

```bash
from django.contrib.auth.models import User, Group
from workshop_app.models import Profile

user, created = User.objects.get_or_create(
    username='instructor_user',
    defaults={'email': 'instructor@gmail.com'}
)

if created:
    user.set_password('1234')
    user.save()

profile, _ = Profile.objects.get_or_create(user=user)
profile.is_email_verified = True
profile.save()

group, _ = Group.objects.get_or_create(name='instructor')
user.groups.add(group)

print("Instructor created successfully ✅")
```


### 🔹 Step 3: Create Coordinator

```bash
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from workshop_app.models import Profile

user, created = User.objects.get_or_create(
    username='coordinator_user',
    defaults={'email': 'coordinator@gmail.com'}
)

if created:
    user.set_password('1234')
    user.save()

profile, _ = Profile.objects.get_or_create(user=user)
profile.is_email_verified = True
profile.save()

print("Coordinator created successfully ✅")
```

Go and Login using the user_id and password


A new Login Page has been implemented using React in the frontend.

---

To run the React frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## Design Decisions & Justification (Reasoning)

### What design principles guided your improvements?

The redesign was guided by core UI/UX principles to enhance usability and clarity:

- Visual Hierarchy – Key actions such as proposing and accepting workshops were emphasized using size, spacing, and contrast to guide user attention.  
- Consistency – A uniform design system (colors, buttons, layouts) was maintained across all pages to ensure a predictable and smooth user experience.  
- Minimalism – Unnecessary elements were removed to reduce clutter and keep the interface clean and focused.  
- Accessibility – Improved color contrast, readable typography, and proper spacing were used to make the interface usable for a wider range of users.  
- User Feedback – Clear success/error messages and interactive states were added to improve user interaction and understanding.  

---

### How did you ensure responsiveness across devices?

Responsiveness was achieved using a mobile-first approach:

- Designed layouts starting from small screens and scaled up for larger devices  
- Used flexbox and responsive grid systems for flexible layouts  
- Avoided fixed widths so components adapt naturally to different screen sizes  
- Optimized buttons and forms for better touch interaction on mobile devices  
- Tested layouts across multiple screen sizes to ensure consistency  

---

### What trade-offs did you make between design and performance?

While improving the UI/UX, performance was carefully considered:

- Avoided heavy animations to maintain fast load times  
- Used lightweight styling instead of heavy UI frameworks  
- Limited external dependencies to reduce overhead  
- Focused on usability and clarity rather than overly complex designs  

This ensured the system remains fast, efficient, and user-friendly.

---

### What was the most challenging part of the task and how did you approach it?

The most challenging part was enhancing the UI without breaking the existing Django backend logic.

- Django templates are tightly coupled with backend data, so even small UI changes could disrupt functionality  
- Managing static files (CSS, JavaScript, images) consistently across pages was challenging  
- Ensuring proper responsiveness required multiple iterations  

Approach:

- Made incremental changes and tested each component carefully  
- Preserved backend structure while improving frontend templates  
- Debugged issues step-by-step to maintain functionality  
- Ensured core features like authentication, booking workflows, and validations remained intact  

---

### Outcome

The final system is:

- More intuitive and user-friendly  
- Fully responsive across devices  
- Visually modern while maintaining performance  
- Efficient and easy to navigate for both instructors and coordinators
